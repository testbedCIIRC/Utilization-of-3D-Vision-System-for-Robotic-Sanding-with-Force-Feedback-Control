# Project Contents

- **Python Files:** Scripts for point cloud processing and path generation.
- **Robot Files:** Control algorithms and programs for the roboti controller.
- **RoboDK Project Files:** Simulation of robotic paths in RoboDK.

# Key Features

- **Point Cloud Processing:** Algorithms to process 3D vision data and generate precise sanding paths.
- **Path Generation:** Generation of zig-zag and spiral patterns for comprehensive surface coverage.
- **Force Feedback Control:** Dynamic adjustment of the robotâ€™s path based on real-time force feedback to maintain consistent pressing force.
- **OPC UA Communication:** Data exchange between system components.
- **Augmented Reality Integration:** Use of Hololens 2 for visualization and interaction with the sanding paths.
